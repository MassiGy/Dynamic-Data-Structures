The code showcased in this repository is written in pascal programming language, in order to be more explicite as it can be, even if it can be a little bit overwelming sometimes.
Besides that, this code is only going to work in a GNU/Unix Fpc Compilers, if you don't have one on board please go and check this  online compiler at this url: https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_pascal_compiler.

At the end, this code is written by me, and I am new to dynamic programming algorithms, so if something can be optimized or transformed into a better state, please reach me on if it worth it, my email is : ghernaoutmassi@gmail.com
